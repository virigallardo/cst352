        <h2> Hello!</h2><br>
          <article> My name is Viridiana (pronounce as Vee-ree-dee-ah-na)
            and this is my professional portfolio website.
            <br>
            I am a Student at CSUMB, and I'm focusing on three concentrations which are: 
            Web, video game, and visual design. 
            <br>
            I have been recently hired at Associated Students at CSUMB as a graphic designer.
            <br>
            Feel free to check out my portfolio, and if you have any question, don't doubt on contacting me!
            
            Thank you very much!
